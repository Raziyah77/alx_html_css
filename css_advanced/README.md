# SmileSchool - CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to the **SmileSchool - CSS Advanced Project**! This project builds upon the foundational HTML structure from the previous phase and dives deep into the power of **CSS** to bring your webpage to life with stunning visual styling.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

The goal of this project is to:

- Understand and apply CSS styling techniques
- Use class selectors, element selectors, and ID selectors
- Compute CSS specificity and understand its implications
- Manipulate layout and spacing using the box model
- Create a visually consistent design by following a professional mockup
- Learn how browsers interpret and render styled HTML pages

## 📄 What’s in this project

This project is based on a design provided in [Figma](https://www.figma.com/file/7z1FqT1v8uVQe7dUIRleLz/SmileSchool-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=Xxz7DLzFDU1xlXgG-0). You are expected to translate that design into a functioning webpage using only HTML and CSS.
